### Static job listing

This is an experiment done with Next.js, the styling was created with the use of tss-react and the animations are done with gsap. I also implemented zustand, for states changes shared between components.

You can view the project at the url: https://luigilucioli.github.io/static-job-listing/

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/luigilucioli/static-job-listing.git
cd static-job-listing
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see the project.
